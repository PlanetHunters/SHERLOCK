To generate an observation plan for your target, you must already have done a fit of your signal using SHERLOCK and go in the resulting folder (usually named "fit_0").
You must also have a file containing basic informations about the (ground) observatories you want to consider, such as the "Observatories.csv" you can find in this example.
Note that Github previews this file and removes the commas between the values, be sure you have them in your own file.
Your "Observatories.csv" file must have these parameters:
  name : name of the observatory (call it whatever makes it for you, it's not regulated).
  tz : the time zone of the observatory, you can leave it empty, SHERLOCK gets it by itself.
  lat : latitude
  lon : longitude
  alt : altitude

Once you have these files, you can execute the planning module of SHERLOCK using this line:
  python3 -m sherlockpipe.plan --observatories Observatories.csv

If you encounter any issue, please refer to the "Troubleshooting" file, still at the draft state, we need your errors to add more :)
If your error is not solved in the "Troubleshooting" file, please let us know about it, so we can work on a patch !

During the execution, SHERLOCK will create a "plan" folder in which you will find two files, one csv and one pdf
